This is a neat little interactive video banner displaying three video elements in diagonally shaped divs with some hover features. notably flex grow is used to expand the elements on hover to bring them into focus, and JavaScript allows the videos to be played and paused by hovering and unhovering the element!

flexbox is also used to make the feature responsive.
